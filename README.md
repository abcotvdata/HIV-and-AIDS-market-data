### CDC data footnotes

"Prevalence" means the number of existing disease cases in a defined population during a specific time period. Prevalence data for the year 2020 are preliminary and based on death data received by CDC as of December 2021. prevalence data from 2010 to present are based on most recent known address.

For all HIV surveillance data: Data for the year 2020 should be interpreted with caution due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on access to HIV testing care-related services and case surveillance activities in state/local jurisdictions. 

Data on diagnoses of HIV infection should be interpreted with caution. Data may not be representative of all persons with HIV because not all infected persons have been tested or tested at a time when the infection could be detected and diagnosed. Also, many states offer anonymous testing; the results of anonymous tests are not reported to the confidential name-based HIV registries of state and local health departments. The data presented in the AtlasPlus provide minimum number of persons for whom HIV infection has been diagnosed and reported to NHSS. In addition, because surveillance practices differ, the reporting and the updating of a personâ€™s clinical and vital status differ among states. The completeness of reporting of HIV diagnoses is estimated at more than 85%.

Death data for the year 2020 are preliminary and based on death data received by CDC as of December 2021. Death data based on residence at death.
